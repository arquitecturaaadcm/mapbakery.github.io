# Sketching Maps: from here to there in an agile world
Sketched maps are an easy way to direct ourself and/or others along a, what seems to be the best, path to a certain point. From the moment that we start with sketching the first map and reaching that point we need to take decisions and we learn as we progress.  
When we sketch maps, we strip away all uneccesary details. Sometimes we also map the dragons to indicate possible dangers (“We don’t know what’s here!” and the dangers of ignorance) like the old mapmakers did.

A map with few well chosen features will give a much better map than a map cluttered with many insignificant features, only simplicity provides a lasting impression.

## The Skeleton
This skeleton becomes visible when you show only the connected features and lines. No matter how many different types of information you want to overlay on the skeleton, the skeleton will always be there for reference. 
These are the steps for making a map skeleton:

Such a skeleton can become very messy (like a bowl of spaghetti), but luckily we can solve it by applying Harry Beck's map making principles.


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Harry Beck</a> designed one of the most famous maps, the iconic map of London’s Underground subway system.

Harry Beck's map provides a coherent overview of a complex world, the world of the London Underground. 
With only horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree lines, the map became a beautiful organizing image of London:

Another way to keep maps simple is to use a small set of visual elements which everybody can understand. I use these:
