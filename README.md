## Mental mapping

Cognitive science and research work in other related areas has shown we develop ‘place cells’ in the brain corresponding to points in the physical or conceptual environment and gradually build them up into a mental map of places, routes and, eventually, areas. 
The mental map we build revolves around the relationship between memorable locations and routes insofar as they are relevant to our needs. 


The way our brains mentally map areas means that when we encounter a new area, we start with specific arrival and destination points. 
From there, we find out routes between these points. We build up knowledge of the area surrounding the nodes and, gradually, clusters of areas (”areas all the way down”). Step by step, we build up our knowledge and increase our mental maps until we have as much information as we need.
