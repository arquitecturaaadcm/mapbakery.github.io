# Sketching Maps: from here to there in an agile world
Sketched maps are an easy way to direct ourself and/or others along a, what seems to be the best, path to a certain point. From the moment that we start with sketching the first map and reaching that point we need to take decisions and we learn as we progress.  
When we sketch maps, we strip away all uneccesary details. Sometimes we also map the dragons to indicate possible dangers (“We don’t know what’s here!” and the dangers of ignorance) like the old mapmakers did.

A map with few well chosen features will give a much better map than a map cluttered with many insignificant features, only simplicity provides a lasting impression.
