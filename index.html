<h1>Diagramming in an agile world</h1>
<div>
<br>
In this faster and faster changing world where people value 
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", "Working software over comprehensive documentation" and "Responding to change over following a plan"</a>
there is still a need for visualizing problems, ideas, concepts, solutions and context. And the fastest way to visualize things is sketching. 
But the problem with freehand sketching or with sketching based on existing modeling languages is that all people who are seeing the sketch must understand the meaning of the visual elements used in the sketch.
That problem is solved with sketching transit maps.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tversky">Barbara Tversky</a> writes <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/046509306X?tag=duc08-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1" target="_top">Mind in Motion</a>, a book about spatial thinking.  Spatial thinking underlies creating and using maps, assembling furniture, devising football strategies, designing airports, understanding the flow of people, traffic, water, and ideas. Spatial thinking even underlies the structure and meaning of language.

This older talk gives a good summary of most of the, for diagramming relevant, ideas in the book: <br>

Proposes a formal design method:
<ol> 
<li>A fundamental skeletal grid that consists of main stations and landmarks (e.g., the River Thames) must be selected as a foundation for the diagram to retain the essential structure of the concrete system.</li>
<li>The relative orientation of all other stations with respect to these fundamental grid points must be maintained.</li>
<li>The relative locations (west, east, north, south) of stations connected by a line must be consistent.</li>
<li>Line orientations in the abstracted map must be kept to a small set. In the London map, for example, there are three (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).</li>
<li>The number of line orientation changes must be kept to a minimum.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Stations can be clustered with other 
stations in sets based on shared properties and the degree 
of affinity between each station pair. As such, each station 
may belong to a number of clusters that represent different 
sets of properties and relations. These clusters form the 
basis for generating the set of possible integration solutions.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the design of transportation maps and diagrams 
for tourist maps and museums, what is the utility of such 
principles and formal techniques? Given that any human interaction with technology can be represented as a network (e.g. , automotive 
climate control system, aircraft fuel system, medical devices), 
it is possible to apply these principles and techniques to the 
design of their (always abstract) interfaces.

			<p> 
When analyzed from <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090036992.pdf">this report’s</a> perspective, the Underground map begins to reveal to us some of the
characteristics of “good”information presentation. Abstraction is used to represent data in a simplified
form that adheres to an underlying grid. Separate elements of information,such as lines,stations, and
platforms, are cast together to create “structures of information”that are then reused in other locales.
"ese modular units of composition, repeating themselves throughout the design,support the sense
of harmony that emanates from this design. Finally, intentional deformations of space,such as enlarging the downtown area and compressing the suburbs, are used to organize information in a way that
accommodates the user’s information requirements. But most importantly, this example highlights the
revolutionary step and courage, on the part of the designer, to escape the “concrete” and familiar form of
presentation when it becomes constraining.

			<h2> Vertesi: <br> Mind the Gap </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p> 
The famous call to ‘Mind the gap’ usually refers to the gap between the train and the platform, this paper will recall another gap: between the iconic, abstract London Underground Map, and users’ stories and practices of navigating, experiencing, and representing the city of London.
<br>
Maps show us where to go and how to get there, serving as sites of interaction and active interpretation as well as wayfinding devices.
<br>
A stable, iconic representation such as the Tube Map may convey a general sense of structure, establish points of interaction, and enable further
representations and narratives about the object. It can act as a reference
point for practices of navigation and wayfinding, affording judgments of
normalcy and degrees of expertise or resistance. 
It thus becomes something of a graphical user interface to the environment, presenting and concealing opportunities for
engagement, and making sense of the environment to its users.

			<h2> Wood: <br> about the Map Skeleton </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p> 
<a href="https://www.deniswood.net/content/gisspdf.pdf">Denis Wood</a> says that all our map technique is based on the creation of a simple network or "skeleton". This skeleton becomes visible when you connected points and lines. No matter how many different types of information you want to overlay on the skeleton, the skeleton will always be there for reference. 
He describes these rules for making such a skeleton: 
<ol>
<li>Pick a centrally located point or particular place. Represent this with a small circle and label it.</li>
<li>Pick your second point the right distance from the first.Try to visualize how far away it is. Remember that this will “set” the scale for the whole map. Use a small circle and label it.</li>
<li>Connect the second point to the first point with a simple line. Number the line 1.</li>
<li>Continue to choose points connecting them to as many previous points as possible. Label all the points and number each line as you add it to the map. Work out from the center in small steps.</li>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_A._Lynch">Kevin Lynch</a> coines the term way-finding in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Image-Harvard-Mit-Joint-Center-Studies/dp/0262620014/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GI9883MAVC3K&dchild=1&keywords=the+image+of+the+city&qid=1586938771&sprefix=the+image+of+the+city%2Caps%2C225&sr=8-1">The Image of the City</a>. He writes: 
"We are supported by the presence of others and by special way-finding devices: maps [...] 
In the process of way-finding, the strategic link is the environmental
image, the generalized mental picture of the [...] world.
Obviously a clear image enables one to move about easily and
quickly [...] But an ordered environment can do more than this; 
it may serve as a broad frame of reference, an organizer of activity or belief
or knowledge. Like any good framework, such a structure gives the [...] possibility
of choice and a starting-point for the acquisition of further information. </p>

			<h2> Beck: <br> The Tube Map </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p> 
        Beck was an English engineering draftsman (used to work with <a href="https://xkcd.com/730/">circuit diagrams</a>) who sparked a small revolution in the early 1930s when he created a radical new map of the London Underground.<br><img src="images/beck_image.png" alt="Harry Beck"> 
<br><br>
"Beck's map was revolutionary in its simplicity," says Sam Mullins, director of the London Transport Museum. "It has become a London icon and influenced the design of many metro maps across the globe, as well as being the inspiration for many contemporary artists and designers."
<br><br>
There is no better summary to this section than Harry Beck’s own description of his initial conception
and design process:
<br>
<i>
Looking at the old map of the Underground railways, it occurred to me that it might be
possible to tidy it up by straightening the lines, experimenting with diagonals and evening
the distance between stations.!e more I thought about it the more convinced I became that
the idea was worth trying, so, selecting the Central London Railways as my horizontal
base line I made a rough sketch. I tried to imagine that I was using a convex lens or mirror, so as to represent the central area on a larger scale.!is, I thought, would give a needed
clarity to the interchange information.</i>
<br><br>
With that touch of ingenious insight, months of detail work on the initial design, and decades of continual improvement, Henry Beck created the most celebrated graphical design of the twentieth century:<br>

In 1928 Leo Marfurt assigned the entire bottom half of a poster to a schematic map of the international connections starting at the Belgian seaport of Ostend (linked to London by ferry). Lines, or in fact arrows, in distinct pastel colors matching the rest of the poster, indicate the various luxury trains, including the Nord Express and Ostende-Wien Orient Express. The arrows start in a bundle at Ostend, but then split up along divergent routes.</p>
