<center><h1>Sketching Maps<br><small><i>from here to there in an agile world</i></small></h1></center>

<section>
  <p>
  <p>
    Sketched maps are an easy way to direct ourself and/or others along a, what seems to be the best, path to a certain point. From the moment that we start with sketching the first map and reaching that point we need to take decisions and we learn as we progress. 
   </p>
   </p> 
  <p>All maps in this post are made with <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw</a>, a very simple to use digital whiteboard program.</p>
  <p>
    We use maps not only as a representation for geographical features like mountains, roads and cities but also for abstract features like concepts and ideas. 
    Maps are small, they show only a few of the multitude of all features. 
    When we sketch maps, we strip away all uneccesary details because a map user doesn't have much time to puzzle things out. 
    And sometimes we also map the dragons to indicate possible dangers (“We don’t know what’s here!” and the dangers of ignorance) like the old mapmakers did.
    A map with few well chosen features will give a much better map than a map cluttered with many insignificant features, only simplicity provides a lasting impression.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the rest of my post I will refer to my digital whiteboard pictures as maps, although some people might say that they are diagrams or just sketches. 
    The reason for this that these are made by using the principles from mapmakers like Denis Wood and Harry Beck. Every map has a skeleton.
    This skeleton becomes visible when you show only the connected features and lines. No matter how many different types of information you want to overlay on the skeleton, the skeleton will always be there for reference. 
    These are the steps for making a map skeleton:

    <p>
      Such a skeleton can become very messy (like a bowl of spaghetti), but luckily we can solve it by applying Harry Beck's map making principles.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Harry Beck</a> designed one of the most famous maps, the iconic map of London’s Underground subway system.<br<br>
      <p><img src="images/beck_image.png" alt="Harry Beck"></p> 
      Harry Beck's map provides a coherent overview of a complex world, the world of the London Underground. 
      With only horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree lines, the map became a beautiful organizing image of London:
      <p><img src="images/Beck.png" alt="Beck's diagramming principles"></p> 
      For apparently quite a number of people, the map organized London (rather than London organizing the map). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to keep maps simple is to use a small set of visual elements which everybody can understand. I use these:
      <ol>
        <li>small circles: for features</li>
        <li>lines: for e.g. paths, links, connections, relationships</li>
        <li>boundaries: for e.g. areas, groups</li>
        <li>arrows: for e.g. direction, action, functionality</li>
      </ol>
      <p><img src="images/DiagrammingTheWorldSketchElements.png" alt="Excalidraw Template"></p>

      I always use a compass to check my maps. But we can't use a real compass when we make a map of abstact things like concepts and ideas.So I made this compass that can be used to check if the map is complete:
      <p><img src="images/compass.png" alt="Compass"></p>
      Of course, if you don't like it you can make your own compass at the start of every new Orienteering game.</strong></i>
