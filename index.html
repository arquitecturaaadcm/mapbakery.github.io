It is easy to get lost in this faster and faster changing agile world where people value 
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", "Working software over comprehensive documentation" and "Responding to change over following a plan"</a>.
To prevent that you can play <strong>Orienteering</strong>:
<br>
<br>
<center><i><strong>
Find the fastest route between a series of features,<br>
using a simple map in the form of a diagram<br>
which will be provided at the start, as navigational aid.<br>
Also improve the map for the next group/session!

And the fastest way to visualize things is sketching. But the problem with freehand sketching or with sketching based on existing modeling languages is that all people who are seeing the sketch must understand the meaning of the visual elements used in the sketch.
That problem is solved by sketching diagrams with elements already known to all human brains:

<ol>
  <li>small circles: for e.g. places, concepts</li>
  <li>lines: for e.g. paths, links, connections, relationships</li>
  <li>boundaries: for e.g. areas, groups</li>
  <li>arrows: for e.g. direction, action, functionality</li>

		</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tversky">Barbara Tversky</a> writes <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/046509306X?tag=duc08-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1" target="_top">Mind in Motion</a>, a book about spatial thinking.  Spatial thinking underlies creating and using maps, assembling furniture, devising football strategies, designing airports, understanding the flow of people, traffic, water, and ideas. Spatial thinking even underlies the structure and meaning of language.
<br>
It’s important to explain here that Nobel Prize-winning research on grid cells provides strong evidence that the brain uses similar methods to track the proximity of ideas and concepts in the mind as it does for the spatial position of physical things in the world. Spatial thinking is a general-purpose set of tools applicable to everything we think about. 
Tversky’s work on how people think and communicate about maps and routes extends into the conceptual realm as well. Overwhelmingly, she’s found that the visual-spatial representation underlies the verbal. This says a lot about how we navigate conceptual complexity as well. Many of the challenges that knowledge workers face are multidimensional in the ways they cut across functional teams or areas of expertise. 
In general, she explains, we look at maps to find routes and then we just follow the routes. If we’re trying to integrate multiple maps, we look for common landmarks and use those to find common routes. The tradeoff with the simplicity of relying on routes is that if we get lost we have no idea where on the map we are (aka the GPS problem).
Therefore you must also understand the whole map.

And there are a number of distortions that people have that indicate that people are constructing their images of environment. So the grid pattern, we tend to line things up in parallel and perpendicular lines and ignore diagonals...

Proposes a formal design method:
<ol> 
<li>A fundamental skeletal grid that consists of main stations and landmarks (e.g., the River Thames) must be selected as a foundation for the diagram to retain the essential structure of the concrete system.</li>
<li>The relative orientation of all other stations with respect to these fundamental grid points must be maintained.</li>
<li>The relative locations (west, east, north, south) of stations connected by a line must be consistent.</li>
<li>Line orientations in the abstracted map must be kept to a small set. In the London map, for example, there are three (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).</li>
<li>The number of line orientation changes must be kept to a minimum.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Stations can be clustered with other 
stations in sets based on shared properties and the degree 
of affinity between each station pair. As such, each station 
may belong to a number of clusters that represent different 
sets of properties and relations. These clusters form the 
basis for generating the set of possible integration solutions.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the design of transportation maps and diagrams 
for tourist maps and museums, what is the utility of such 
principles and formal techniques? Given that any human interaction with technology can be represented as a network (e.g. , automotive 
climate control system, aircraft fuel system, medical devices), 
it is possible to apply these principles and techniques to the 
design of their (always abstract) interfaces.

			<p> 
When analyzed from <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090036992.pdf">this report’s</a> perspective, the Underground map begins to reveal to us some of the
characteristics of “good”information presentation. Abstraction is used to represent data in a simplified
form that adheres to an underlying grid. Separate elements of information,such as lines,stations, and
platforms, are cast together to create “structures of information”that are then reused in other locales.
"ese modular units of composition, repeating themselves throughout the design,support the sense
of harmony that emanates from this design. Finally, intentional deformations of space,such as enlarging the downtown area and compressing the suburbs, are used to organize information in a way that
accommodates the user’s information requirements. But most importantly, this example highlights the
revolutionary step and courage, on the part of the designer, to escape the “concrete” and familiar form of
presentation when it becomes constraining.

			<h2> Vertesi: <br> Mind the Gap </h2>

		<div class="description">
			<p> 
The famous call to ‘Mind the gap’ usually refers to the gap between the train and the platform, this paper will recall another gap: between the iconic, abstract London Underground Map, and users’ stories and practices of navigating, experiencing, and representing the city of London.
<br>
Maps show us where to go and how to get there, serving as sites of interaction and active interpretation as well as wayfinding devices.
<br>
A stable, iconic representation such as the Tube Map may convey a general sense of structure, establish points of interaction, and enable further
representations and narratives about the object. It can act as a reference
point for practices of navigation and wayfinding, affording judgments of
normalcy and degrees of expertise or resistance. 
It thus becomes something of a graphical user interface to the environment, presenting and concealing opportunities for
engagement, and making sense of the environment to its users.

				<quote>Syntactic consistency is of paramount importance
in graphic design as it is in all human endeavors. Grids are one of the several tools helping designers to achieve syntactical consistency in graphic design. 
We design things which we think are semantically correct and syntactically consistent but if, at the point of fruition, no one understands the result, or
the meaning of all that effort, the entire work is useless. Sometimes it may need some explanation but it is better when not necessary.

He writes: 
"We are supported by the presence of others and by special way-finding devices: maps [...] 
In the process of way-finding, the strategic link is the environmental
image, the generalized mental picture of the [...] world.
Obviously a clear image enables one to move about easily and
quickly [...] But an ordered environment can do more than this; 
it may serve as a broad frame of reference, an organizer of activity or belief
or knowledge. Like any good framework, such a structure gives the [...] possibility
of choice and a starting-point for the acquisition of further information. </p>

<quote>
Harry Beck's diagram of the 7+ lines of the London Underground, although geographically inaccurate, provides a coherent overview of a 
complex system. With excellent color printing, classic British railroad typography (by Edward Johnson), and, in the modern style,
only horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree lines, the map became a beautiful organizing image of London. 
For apparently quite a number of people, the map organized London (rather than London organizing the map). 
Despite 70 years of revision due to extensions of the Underground and bureaucratic tinkering 
(the marketing department wrecked the map for several years), the map nicely survives to this day.

			<p> 
My ancestor Arent Roggeveen (d.1679) was a navigator and mapmaker. He moved to Middelburg in 1658, which at the time was the seat of both the Dutch West and East India Companies. He worked for both companies teaching navigation and overseeing their collection of maps and portolans. He began to create and compile charts of West Indies and North America in the 1660s, using the work of earlier cartographers including Hessel Gerritsz and Joan Vingboons. The collection was called ‘Het Brandede Veen’, meaning ‘The Burning Fen’, a play on his name: fen was often used to create warning beacons on coasts for ships. This was the first pilot guide to show the entire coastline of North America on a large scale, and one of the first to name the island of Manhattan. It was published by Pieter Goos in 1675.
