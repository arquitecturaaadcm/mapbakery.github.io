        Beck was an English engineering draftsman who sparked a small revolution in the early 1930s when he created a radical new map of the London Underground. <img src="images/beck_image.png" alt="Harry Beck"> "Beck's map was revolutionary in its simplicity," Sam Mullins, director of the London Transport Museum, said at Monday's unveiling ceremony, which coincided with the Underground's ongoing 150th anniversary celebration. "It has become a London icon and influenced the design of many metro maps across the globe, as well as being the inspiration for many contemporary artists and designers."
