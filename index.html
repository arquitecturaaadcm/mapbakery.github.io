Spatial thinking underlies creating and using maps, assembling furniture, devising football strategies, designing airports, understanding the flow of people, traffic, water, and ideas. Spatial thinking even underlies the structure and meaning of language.

        The impact that <a href="https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/">Imhof</a> has had on cartography, is based on the combination of scientific sense, artistic talent and technical proficiency, something that is rarely found in a single person. Through this combination, his horizon was broader and he had a better overview of the whole subject than most of his colleagues. A lot can be learned from his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cartographic-Relief-Presentation-Press-Classics/dp/1589480260/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=eduard+imhof&qid=1586938435&sr=8-1">Carthographic Relief Presentation</a>, like "sketching forces us into objective and graphic abstraction, into the transformation of complex phenomena to a few simple lines and strokes"

Denis Wood says that all our map technique is based on the creation of a simple network or "skeleton". This skeleton becomes visible when you connected points and lines. No matter how many different types of information you want to overlay on the skeleton, the skeleton will always be there for reference. 
He describes these rules for making such a skeleton: 
<ol>
<li>Pick a centrally located point or particular place. Represent this with a small circle and label it.</li>
<li>Pick your second point the right distance from the first.Try to visualize how far away it is. Remember that this will “set” the scale for the whole map. Use a small circle and label it.</li>
<li>Connect the second point to the first point with a simple line. Number the line 1.</li>
<li>Continue to choose points connecting them to as many previous points as possible. Label all the points and number each line as you add it to the map. Work out from the center in small steps.</li>

        Beck was an English engineering draftsman who sparked a small revolution in the early 1930s when he created a radical new map of the London Underground. <img src="images/beck_image.png" alt="Harry Beck"> "Beck's map was revolutionary in its simplicity," says Sam Mullins, director of the London Transport Museum. "It has become a London icon and influenced the design of many metro maps across the globe, as well as being the inspiration for many contemporary artists and designers."
