  <h2>John R. Boyd's OODA ideas</h2>
  <p>
    Sketched maps are an easy way to direct ourself and/or others along a more or less designated path to a target. From the moment that we start with sketching the first map and reaching the target we need to take decisions and we learn as we progress. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_%28military_strategist%29">John R. Boyd</a> thought and talked almost is whole military career how we take decisions and learn in fast changing uncertain environments.
    His ideas are described in this 400 pages long <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0151_Boyd_Discourse_Winning_Losing.PDF">A Discourse on Winning and Losing</a> book.
    Luckily, this book contains an Appendix which summarizes Boyd's ideas about how are decision-making and learning system works by visualizing it in the OODA loop. The letters OODA stand for:
      <ul>
        <li>Observe: this is the part in which your use eyes and ears to observe, to scan the environment</li>
        <li>Orient: this is te part where you try to understand (evaluate) your situation in relation to what you scanned. And what routes you can take to reach your (next) control point. </li>
        <li>Decide: based on your orientation you choose what you think is the best possible next step that you will take</li>
        <li>Act: and then you take that next step...</li>
      </ul>
  <p>I use deliberatly the term "control point"at in the Orient description because in Agile you don't have fixed targets and goals but you work with mostly time-based control points like for example daily standups and sprints.</p> 
  </p>
    I made this simplified sketched map of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop#/media/File:OODA.Boyd.svg">Boyd's OODA loop</a>:

  <h2>Orienteering</h2>
  <p>
    For this post I use info and books available on the <a href="https://www.orienteeringontario.ca/">Ontario Orienteering</a> website.
    Orienteering originated in Sweden in the late 19th century with the military. The term "orienteering" meant the crossing of unknown land with a map and compass.
    It’s a workout for both body and brain combining an outdoor physical adventure with map reading and navigational skills.
    The skill in orienteering is in choosing the best route between controls through geographical features, as you progress you will learn to decide between options.
    Here uou see an example of an orienteering map, withe the route and the controls plotted on a geographic map:
    <p><img src="images/course.gif" alt="Orienteering Map"></p>
    <p>My first idea was to replace the orientation part of the OODA loop with orienteering. But when I read more about orienteering I realized that orienteering covers thw whole OODA loop. To show that I've replaced Boyd's orientation with orienteering 
    and added the hatched box to indicate that orienteering not only replaces orientation but that it also overlaps (has similarities) with all other parts of the original OODA loop!
    <p><img src="images/OODA.png" alt="The OODA loop"></p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The other way round, mapping examples from orienteering on the OODA loop, makes the overlapping more clear. In this map I've plotted aspects from the orienteering sport on my sketched map of the OODA loop (and I corrected some typo's):

  <h2>Agile</h2>
  <p>
    Jim Highsmith, one of the 17 original signatories of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile Manifesto</a>, says on the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html">About the Agile Manifesto</a> page:
  <quote><i><br><br>
    The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology.<br>
    We want to restore a balance.<br>
    We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository.<br> 
    We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes.<br>
    We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.<br>
  <br></i></quote>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the Agile movement didn't restore the balance. People used the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile Manifesto</a> as an excuse to invest even less time in quality documentation than they did before.
    Nowadays, thanks to Agile, we got documentation in the form of Post-It notes or just the code. Both are not useful for people who can't read the code and weren't present at all those stand-ups or demo sessions. 
    Agile teams are so focused on optimizing their internal continuous integration and continuous delivery processes, that they forget that you also need some kind of situational awareness to make the right decisions. <stong>And they make it impossible for others to gain a reliable situational awareness!!!</strong>
    This is the part of the OODA loop that is essential for gaining a situational awareness:

  <h2>Sketched maps to the rescue</h2>
  <p>All maps in this post are made with <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw</a>, a very simple to use digital whiteboard program.</p>
  <p>
    We use maps not only as a representation for geographical features like mountains, roads and cities but also for abstract features like concepts and ideas. 
    Maps are small, they show only a few of the multitude of all features. 
    When we sketch maps, we strip away all uneccesary details because a map user doesn't have much time to puzzle things out. 
    And sometimes we also map the dragons to indicate possible dangers (“We don’t know what’s here!” and the dangers of ignorance) like the old mapmakers did.
    A map with few well chosen features will give a much better map than a map cluttered with many insignificant features, only simplicity provides a lasting impression.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the rest of my post I will refer to my digital whiteboard pictures as maps, although some people might say that they are diagrams or just sketches. 
    The reason for this that these are made by using the principles from mapmakers like Denis Wood and Harry Beck. Every map has a skeleton.
    This skeleton becomes visible when you show only the connected features and lines. No matter how many different types of information you want to overlay on the skeleton, the skeleton will always be there for reference. 
    These are the steps for making a map skeleton:
    <p><img src="images/MapFeatures.png" alt="MapFeatures"></p>
    <p>
      Such a skeleton can become very messy (like a bowl of spaghetti), but luckily we can solve it by applying Harry Beck's map making principles.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck">Harry Beck</a> designed one of the most famous maps, the iconic map of London’s Underground subway system.<br<br>
      <p><img src="images/beck_image.png" alt="Harry Beck"></p> 
      Harry Beck's map provides a coherent overview of a complex world, the world of the London Underground. 
      With only horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree lines, the map became a beautiful organizing image of London:
      <p><img src="images/Beck.png" alt="Beck's diagramming principles"></p> 
      For apparently quite a number of people, the map organized London (rather than London organizing the map). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to keep maps simple is to use a small set of visual elements which everybody can understand. I use these:
      <ol>
        <li>small circles: for features</li>
        <li>lines: for e.g. paths, links, connections, relationships</li>
        <li>boundaries: for e.g. areas, groups</li>
        <li>arrows: for e.g. direction, action, functionality</li>
      </ol>
      <p><img src="images/DiagrammingTheWorldSketchElements.png" alt="Excalidraw Template"></p>

      I always use a compass to check my maps. But we can't use a real compass when we make a map of abstact things like concepts and ideas.So I made this compass that can be used to check if the map is complete:
      <p><img src="images/compass.png" alt="Compass"></p>
      Of course, if you don't like it you can make your own compass at the start of every new Orienteering game.</strong></i>
